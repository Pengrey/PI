# Export API - Swagger generated server

## Overview
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project. By using the
[OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/wiki) from a remote server, a server stub was easily generated.

This server uses the [Connexion](https://github.com/zalando/connexion) library on top of Flask.

## Requirements
Python 3.8.10 or newer, preferably

The server uses PySpark to communicate with the data lake. It is included in `requirements.txt`.

## Environment variables

| Name | Description | Examples | Default |
|------|-------------|----------|---------|
| EXPORT_BASE_PATH | the path from where the application should obtain the data | `hdfs://<IP>:<PORT>/` | `file:///tmp/` |
| PYSPARK_PYTHON | the Python binary to use for PySpark | `/usr/bin/python3` | None |

Note: `PYSPARK_PYTHON` may have to be set if the API is running on a virtual environment

## Usage
To run the server, please execute the following from the root directory:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 -m crowdsorcerer_server_export
```

and open your browser to here:

```
http://localhost:8080/api/export/ui/
```

The Swagger definition lives here:

```
http://localhost:8080/api/export/swagger.json
```

To launch the integration tests, use tox:
```
sudo pip install tox
tox
```

## Running with Docker

To run the server on a Docker container, please execute the following from the root directory:

```bash
# building the image
docker build -t crowdsorcerer_server_export .

# starting up a container
docker run -p 8080:8080 crowdsorcerer_server_export
```
