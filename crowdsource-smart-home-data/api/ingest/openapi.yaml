            # Data upload

            Through the Home Assistant Aggregator, each home produces a data payload that is inserted into the platform as it is received.
            Each of these payloads is associated with an UUID, which is stored within the Aggregator instances and is sent along with the data.
            The data upload to the platform is done publicly, with no proper authentication.
            
            *As it stands, this UUID effectively identifies the home that produced its data, but no guarantees are made that the UUID was used by a single home, or if any data it is associated with is forged.*

            # Data deletion

            Completely delete data associated with an UUID.
            This is the operation behind the Forget/Opt-out feature.
            The users have the right to delete all records from the platform at any time, provided they have the UUID that they uploaded the data by.
            
            This operation can be executed publicly on any UUID, but no feedback is transmitted on whether or not the UUID existed previously on the platform.
            Although, if the operation fails for some reason, that is explicitly expressed.
