Based on [@iantrich](https://www.github.com/iantrich)'s boilerplate card

## Installing Through HACS

This assumes that you have HACS installed and configured on your HA installation. See [here](https://hacs.xyz/) for more information.

### Step 1

[Add the following link as a Custom Repository in HACS](https://hacs.xyz/docs/faq/custom_repositories), in the Lovelace/Frontend category:

https://github.com/CrowdSorcerer/crowdsourcerer-card

### Step 2

[Download the "Crowdsourcerer Card" repository](https://hacs.xyz/docs/navigation/stores) in the Frontend tab.

### Step 3

You can now add the card to a dashboard of your choice, when adding a new card it should be available as "Custom: Crowdsourcerer Card".

If the card does not show up in the card list, try restarting HA and clearing the browser cache.


## Installing on Home Assistant Manually 

### Step 1

Copy the files from `/dist` to the `www` folder in your Home Assistant installation's config folder
(create the `www` folder if it does not exist)

### Step 2

Enable "Advanced Mode" in HA under profile settings

### Step 3

Edit a dashboard view, by clicking the 3 dots in the upper right corner of a dashboard
(you may be asked to take control of the dashboard, try creating a new dashboard instead to experiment)

### Step 4

While editing the dashboard, click the 3 dots once more and select "Manage Resources"

### Step 5

Add `crowdsourcerer-card.js` as a module, using the URL `/local/crowdsourcerer-card.js`

A HA reboot may be needed for changes to take effect

### Step 6

You can now add the card to the dashboard. Back in the dashboard editor, click "ADD CARD".
The new card should show up in the list as "Custom: Crowdsourcerer Card".

If the card does not show up, try clearing the browser cache, or click the 3 dots in the dashboard editor, then "Raw configuration editor".
Then, add the following under the "cards:" tag and save
```yaml
- type: custom:crowdsourcerer-card
```
