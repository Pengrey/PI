- Aggregator: +2 weeks of development (to 22/05)
  - The HA component proved to be harder to develop than anticipated. By the time the prototype had to be presented (M3), sensitive and time-consuming features such as anonymization and the Dashboard Card still had to begin development, and 1 week wouldnâ€™t be enough to have those features done properly. Therefore, 2 weeks were added, giving 3 weeks to develop the missing features including finishing the current ones.
